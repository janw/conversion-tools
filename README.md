# Collection of conversion tools and scripts

I regularly find myself in situations where certain conversion tasks take up a lot of time when done manually. This repository is supposed to alleviate that. Whenever I stumble upon a task that can be done in batch or by handling through a script, I'll add it to this collection.

In my personal quest to learn more about Python and establish it as my personal programming language of choice, I am going to implement using Python 3 (if not noted otherwise). This might be senseless (for example, when a simple bash script would suffice and handle things faster and easier), but I see it as a personal challenge.
